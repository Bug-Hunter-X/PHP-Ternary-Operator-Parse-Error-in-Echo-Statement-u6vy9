This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to using the ternary operator within an echo statement.  The error arises when trying to directly output the result of a ternary operation that involves concatenating strings.  If the result of the condition is a non-string value, it will lead to a parse error.

```php
<?php
echo "The result is: " . (true ? 1 : 0);
?>
```
This will result in a parse error because PHP tries to interpret the number 1 or 0 as part of the string concatenation, which is invalid syntax.
